Raspberry Pi is a low cost, **credit card sized computer** that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is an incredibly capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in a variety of computer languages like Scratch and Python. It is capable of doing everything you would expect from a desktop computer, such as browsing the internet, playing high-definition video content, creating spreadsheets, performing word-processing, and playing video games. For more information, you can refer to Raspberry Pi official `website <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_. For clarification, this tutorial will also reference Raspberry Pi as RPi, RPI and RasPi.

We provide both C and Python code for each project in this tutorial.

This kit does not contain Raspberry and its accessories. You can also use the components and modules in this kit to create projects of your own design.
